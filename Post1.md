## Post 1

I think many a time the news cycle we are familiar with underestimates the importance of scientific discoveries as their significance and their buzz value cannot match up to that of current events of political or financial nature. Which is really a shame, because it means that science is not getting as big a spotlight as it should in society, even though it arguably contributes more to humanity’s progress than the typical newstories that make the headlines. There are many different pieces recent of science and tech news that I feel should have been paid more attention, though today I want to focus more on the discovery of phosphine gas on Venus.

Yes, it is definitely an old piece of news considering that the discovery was first announced in September. It recently came to the forefront again in scientific journals as the scientists involved in the study revised their estimations of the phosphine levels to a lower reading, effectively decreasing the chances of life in the planet’s atmosphere. It was not much of a big deal to the news media, and had I not browsed nature’s news articles that day I would not have known about it.

Astronomy was one of those subjects that I flirted with slightly but never made significant headway into as there was nothing to fuel my passion for it. I found it interesting, but there was no opportunity to turn that spark of curiosity into a more serious endeavour. I content myself with reading and occasionally thinking about the profound impact of the kinds of things astronomers deal with, one of the biggest in my opinion would be that of the possibility of life on other planets.

It is a really exciting prospect, and it is made all the more exciting when I think of all the possibilities for progress within my lifetime. At one point in time I believed that I was part of the generation that was born in between two great eras – too late to explore the world, too early to explore the galaxy. And while that may be true in part recent innovations, advances in space technology, and discoveries such as these do offer a ray of hope.

It’s interesting to think about how a seismic discovery such as that of extraterrestrial life will sit with the general public. Will there be mass hysteria and denial? We have come close to making such declarative statements before, two instances come to mind: first the discovery of pulsars in the 1960s were initially attributed to (among other options) alien broadcasts and then the 1990s discovery of the Allan Hills fossils that purportedly came from Mars. And in a climate of increasing mistrust of science and research there is really no saying how humans will react to the news. I think it will be very interesting to watch, but I think when the time comes, if it does, it will be a bit by bit revelation – one which increases in certainty as more and more information is verified, gaining adherents, silencing detractors until the claim becomes a statement of undeniable truth. Maybe this discovery on Venus will be the start of it all.

The prescence of flat-earthers and other science-deniers makes me slightly worried for the future, however, I digress. Surely life is full of surprises, and although with work picking up and deadlines looming my life seems like one tumultuous snowball hurtling down a slope, I think small pieces of news like this keep me hopeful and optimistic for the future.
